- 🪆 A little about me:
- 🍫 I have a chocolate addiction, and it's almost Christmas 🥹 
- 🎧 Music, the most constant thing in my life, it's the only competition to games. I'm not very good but I learned piano and guitar alone!
- 🦸🏽 I love Marvel, DC, Anime, and basically everything that comes from letting your imagination go wild!
- 🥋 I practice Taewkwondo (sadly stopped for a while).
